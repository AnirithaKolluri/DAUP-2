# Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition

## ðŸ“˜ Course Project
This is my **3-2 Semester project** for the course **Data Analysis Using Python (DAUP)**.  
The objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques for solving real-world classification problems using image datasets.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Title
**Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition Dataset**

---

## ðŸ“„ Project Description
The aim of this project is to build and evaluate classification models that can recognize and categorize images of fruits and vegetables.  
The dataset contains high-resolution images organized into folders by class label, and preprocessing techniques were applied before model training.  
The outcome demonstrates how machine learning can be used effectively for computer visionâ€“based applications such as smart agriculture, food recognition, and automated sorting systems.

## âœ… Project Goals
- Acquire and preprocess the dataset for training and testing.  
- Implement classification models to distinguish between fruits and vegetables.  
- Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics.  
- Identify the best-performing model with respect to accuracy.
